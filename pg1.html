            <h1>First Steps</h1><br><br>
            
            <pre>
    #include < iostream >
    using namespace std;
    int main (){
        
        (code);
        
        return 0;
                
    }</pre><br>

            <p>This is a framework for writing code ðŸ‘†</p><br>

            <p>"cin" is input. you can input any quanity of numbers, example: if you want to input 1 number, you will do this_cin>>a; ("a" is a something number that you will input). if you want to input 2 numbers, you will must to do this_cin>>a>>b;, if 3, this_cin>>a>>b>>c;  and so on.</p><br><br>

            <pre>
    #include < iostream >
    using namespace std;
    int main() { 
        
        int sum, a, b; 
        cin >> a >> b; 
        sum = a + b; 
        cout << sum; 
        
        return 0; 
                
    }</pre><br>

        <p>For example this (ðŸ‘†) program will sum up any of your chosen two numbers</p><br>
        <p>I told, that "a" is a something number, it is a name of variable, integer. to input or do Mathematical operations on it, first you need to announce it with function "int". Example: int a; after this you can input and do mathematical operations on it. I will explain what "int" function does.</p><br>

        <p>Through an int, a box is created in the computer's memory, with the name whatever you call it. For example: int a; He created a drawer called "a". But you can name not only the letter, but also the name. For example, if we want a cell in which the sum of two numbers will be stored, we can create it and name it like this: int sum; If, for example, the number of five-digit numbers, then so: int fivedigit_quantity; and so on. we can name it what we want.</p><br>

        <p>Now, we must learn how to do mathematical operations on numbers what we input, but first we must to learn something until that. There is something in C++ that is much needed. This is an assignment. We can see this in that program upper: "sum = a + b;". this is assignment. We told our program to assignment "a+b" to sum. that means that if a=1 and b=2, sum will equal to 3.  You can also subtract, multiply, divide, and take the remainder. subtract_"-". multiply_"*". divide_"/". take the remainder_"%".</p><br>

        <p>Now, I will told you the important thing in c++ coding language. I don't know, but I think you've already noticed that I put a semicolon at the end of every function, assignment, and so on. This is an ending of each function. if you dont put semicolon, code will be wrong And it will give you an error, so remember this.</p><br>

        <p>Now we will learn how to output our answer. in my program, (upper ðŸ‘†) you can see this: "cout << sum;". this is a output.  when we input a "a" and "b", (in our example 1 and 2), we told our program to assignment "a+b" to the sum. then, we output the sum.(sum of "a" and "b", 1 and 2) it will output 3, because 1+2 equals to 3.</p><br>

        <p>Now we know, that this program outputs sum of to integers, "a" and "b". if you input 2 and 4, it will output 6, if 5 and 10, it will output 15 and so on. this was a simple c++ program, we used int, console input (cin), assigment, mathematical operations ("+" but we learned "-", "*", "/", "%" too), and console output (cout). (that was kinda easy u know :0)</p><br>
